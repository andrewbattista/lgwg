# Label Descriptions

The group working projects have been divided into several categories of tasks and issues to facilitate work. A [list of all labels and issues associated with them is here](https://github.com/andrewbattista/lgwg/labels). These definitions are meant to help members of the working group (and beyond) understand the scope of the projects they'll take on, and they strive to ensure that many people with different skillsets and interests are able to take part in the group's work

### a-z databases
Pertains to the management of A-Z resources within LibGuides. KARMS staff handles most of these design and implementation choices

### accessibility
Involves work directly related to parts of the site that involve accessibility. This could include design choices, site cleanup, or other improvements to facilitate access

### assessment
Any kind of work that involves the extraction of site usage data, whether from Springshare or Google Analytics. These projects often involve cleaning data, visualizing it, and making it available for community insight

### best practices
Issues with this label inherently involve making decisions about system rules and usages (and then writing them down on the site documentation).

### bug
This label represents features in LibGuides that are broken and are prohibiting a critical thing from happening. They should receive a higher level of attention.

### cleanup
This label indicates projects in which it is required to weed out or otherwise change links, images, guides, or pages that have broken or degraded because of system changes, link rot, or other related challenges

### content review
Projects that involve some kind of systematic and often subjective assessment of the content on a LibGuide or within the system as a whole. Often, the issue requires decisions, documentation, and work to implement changes that affect the quality, pedagogical soundness, and freshness of content

### css
Issues with this label almost certainly involve some working knowledge of CSS (including how to write it and apply it in custom guide style sheets)

### data wrangling
These tasks almost certainly require some basic fluidity with downloading data into a spreadsheet and cleaning it or otherwise manipulating it to facilitate work

### design
Issues in this category are related to principles of design, which are ideally rooted in sound user experience and pedagogy

### enhancement
This issue is driven by some request for functionality that doesn't exist yet but could if the group decides it's a good idea and thinks that it's possible or worth pursuing

### html
This issue requires some basic knowledge of HTML

### out of scope
This label is given to issues that have been proposed and after some level of exploration are deemed to be out of the scope of the group

### pedagogy
The proposed changes or site alterations associated with this issue are particularly implicated in questions of pedagogy. That is, issues in this category should be made in the context of serving people who are not merely "users" but instead are learners who are entering into a community of inquiry

### requires consensus
Issues with this label are particularly in need of group or community buy-in before moving forward. As many people as possible in the group are expected to weigh in, either with thumbs up or down, or with comments, as the project is taken on

### socio-technical
Issues in this category are often not technical challenges as much as they are challenges in social or organization culture. They can be changes or decisions that require buy-in or understanding (or just communication in general)
