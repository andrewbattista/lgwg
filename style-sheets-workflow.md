# Plan for Managing Stylesheets

LibGuides has a somewhat precarious method of housing stylesheets that are used for many of the look and feel elements. We are proposing a process for versioning the stylesheets and testing out improvements or changes.

### Testing out new stylesheets

* Log on to the admin side of LibGuides. Start by copying the existing stylesheet or starting from scratch.
* Navigate to Admin > Groups. Select the **System Development** group and click the pencil icon to edit.
* Navigate to the **Custom JS/CSS** tab, and paste in whatever edits you have
* Visit some of the test guides in the group to see how your changes look

### Establishing new versions

To be continued.
