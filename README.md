# NYU Libraries LibGuides Global Working Group

This repository is a space for basic documents, issues, and work projects for the NYU Libraries LibGuides Global Working Group. We primarily use this repository for its project management features, but it's also a good space for everyone in the NYU Libraries Community to see our work process. The group invites contributions and input from anyone at NYU who is interested in what happens to LibGuides. For additional information about the group, [refer to the Group Documents](https://guides.nyu.edu/lgwg) or the Library Wiki.

## Joining the Group

Anyone who works within NYU Libraries is welcome to join the group and make contributions to our site. Work will be facilitated by team leaders who have previously served on the LibGuides Global Working Group.

## Code of Conduct

Although this working group is not a traditional software development project, we will adopt some of the conventions of collaborative software development to guide our process and ensure a safe, welcoming, space. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) will be our point of departure for describing our work and our expectations.

## Group Process and Norms

Members of the working group are expected to self-assign issues, work on them, and implement changes or submit a report on proposed changes on the issue during working group meetings. Here's a few norms about the process of the group:

* Make every effort to complete the issue you choose before the stated deadline
* Don't make any changes or decisions that you aren't comfortable with making; ask questions to someone else in the group first
* For issues that require consensus, don't implement a change until you have documented that consensus on the issue itself has been gathered
* Make every effort to attend working group meetings, in person or virtually
* Be open about the status of your work project and what you need to get it done
